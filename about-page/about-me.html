        <p>However, let's start with a little preview of who I am as a person.
            Like I said, I'am a 19 years old girl full of dreams and determination.
            I lived my all life in a small town called Jibou, from SÄƒlaj, but recently
            I moved to Cluj-Napoca, where I want to build my life from now.
            I consider myself a temperate and patient person, but also a stubborn one.
            I think these "qualities" have made my life a little easier growing up,
            knowing what I want and working to get it. So, I know I'm just a teenager,
            but I know I can prove I'm ambitious and smart enough to become a Web Developer.
        </p>

        <div id="hobbies">
            <b>In my free time, I like to explore my artist side. So here are a few activities that
                fill my free time:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <div class="hobbyTitle">
                        <i class="fas fa-guitar"></i>
                        <b> Playing guitar</b>
                    </div>
                    <p>One of my favorite activity that's relaxing me is playing guitar.
                        I started learning at 14 years old, and 5 years later I still enjoy it.
                        I'm playing at the church, sometimes alone, sometimes with a group of teenagers.
                        In the future I would love to learn playing the violin as well,
                        so that's a future plan I'm working on.

                        <b> Reading books</b>
                    </div>
                    <p>Though I'm having trouble enjoying my hobbies nowadays,
                        I still make time to read everyday. One of my favorite author is
                        Karen Kingsbury, that has writen "Divine" and "Two weeks".
                        Her books are filled with a great, miraculous and unshakable
                        reality: God's grace is greater than our suffering.
                        I have no words to characterize the way she writes.
                        You'll find her books right here => <i class="fas fa-book-reader" id="second"></i> </p>

                    <p>Like all people in the world, I have odd habits. When I'm upset and don't wanna
                        talk to anybody I lock myself in the kitchen and cook something sweet, like cookies or cake.
                        My favorite desert to cook is pancakes, and here are some pics of my preparates =>
